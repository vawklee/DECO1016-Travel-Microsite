				<h2> Beaches </h2>
				<p>
					Cheung Chau has plenty of beaches for you to visit, whether you like to take a stroll, enjoy the views or participate in watersports such as kayaking. Notable beaches on the island include Tung Wan Beach and Kwun Yam Wan Beach for an accessible family friendly beach. For secluded beaches that include a short hike, it is recommended to visit Tung Wan Tsai (also known as Coral Beach) and Pak Tso Wan Beach.

				<h2> Hiking </h2>
				<p>
					For beautiful views of the sea and nature, you should check out the North Lookout Pavilion; it is roughly a 20 minute walk from the ferry pier where you arrive on the island, and has stairs with handrails. <br> <br> If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, you should definitely take a hike to the Cheung Po Tsai Cave; from there, you will be able to see the gorgeous coastline of Cheung Chau, as well as engage in a little bit of ‘treasure hunting’ if you wish, as this cave is believed to be the storage place of the pirate Cheung Po Tsai’s loot. Make sure to bring appropriate footwear and a torch, as this hike can get slippery!

				<h2> Food & Drink </h2> 
				<p>
					Cheung Chau is the perfect location for you to visit if you wish to get a taste of local Hong Kong style cuisine; including fresh seafood, trendy cafés for your social media feeds, and the classic curried fish balls from street markets, as well as street stalls with local desserts such as tofu pudding <strong>(豆腐花)</strong>. Recommended restaurants to eat at while on the island include:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Bayview Chinese Restaurant</strong>, which true to the venue name, has gorgeous views of the South China Sea and provides a large dimsum menu for breakfast and lunch, and serves classic Cantonese style cuisine for dinner
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Hometown Teahouse</strong>, a small homely restaurant that serves soft red bean pancakes and hand-rolled sushi but this location is known to get crowded during peak hours so takeaway is a great option for your dining needs
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>New Baccarat</strong>, owned by a fishing family, it is one of the original seafood restaurants on the island and the seafood is always guaranteed to be freshly caught!
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Outdoor Cafe</strong>, an average sized café that serves Western cuisine, such as roast beef and pasta, as well as serving cocktails and tapas during the evening, along with lounge music as you eat!
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2> Bike Riding </h2> 
				<p>
					There are several shops around the island of Cheung Chau where you can hire bicycles for the day. Bikes make travelling across the island much easier, while still allowing you to take in the views along the way. There are even bikes with multiple seats, if you wish to share with the group you may be travelling with; just be careful as some pathways around Cheung Chau may not fit the multi-seat bikes.

				<h2> Explore the Area </h2>
				<p>
					Notable locations to visit while on Cheung Chau include the Pak Tai temple, or Yuk Hui temple (which is what shows up on Google Map searches). The Pak Tai temple is dedicated to the God of the Sea, Pak Tai, and is the main location for the local Bun Festival that occurs every year on the island. Another temple that you should visit while on Cheung Chau is the Tin Hau temple, nearby to the Pak Tai temple, with other temples located north of Morning Beach and southwest of the island. Locals often pay respects to the Goddess of the Sea for good fortune and protection before they travel out to sea. This temple is often visited on Tin Hau’s birthday, falling on the 23rd of the 3rd lunar month. <br> <br> Outside of visiting temples, you should explore San Hing street and Pak She street for a variety of shops selling homemade crafts and trendy new cafés; a great place for your social media content creating needs, thanks to the abundance of young residents who now call Cheung Chau their home and have rejuvenated the area with plenty of currently trending attractions. These streets will also be selling plenty of snacks for you to enjoy while you walk! On the southwest of the island, Tai Hing Tai road and Tai San Praya road will provide you with amazing waterfront views and the opportunity to enjoy fresh seafood snacks, such as the classic curried fish balls.

				Cheung Chau celebrates the Bun Festival in the fourth month of the lunar calendar, where people pay respects at the temple for luck and protection, and to celebrate the end of a plague that occurred in the past. <br> <br> The festival honours the deity Pak Tai, and consists of many activities including lion dances, games, ceremonies and towers of buns (hence the name "Bun Festival") that participants may climb in order to reach the highest bun of the tower. The sweet steamed buns featured in this festival are a white flour bun filled with a lotus seed paste, and are believed to bring good luck and fortune to those who eat them. <br> <br> The festival is celebrated for 3 days and is considered a holiday on Cheung Chau, with participants traditionally eating vegetarian food for the first two days and until the morning of the third day. In 2022, this festival was celebrated from the 6th to 9th of May. <br> <br> Visitors are always more than welcome to join the celebrations, so you should find the time to travel to Cheung Chau during the fourth month of the lunar calendar in order to experience the lively activities that occur during the Bun Festival, as well as taste the iconic steamed buns for some good fortune!
